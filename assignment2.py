# This file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive)
# in some order, with no integer repeated.

# Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the ithi^{th}ith row
# of the file indicates the ithi^{th}ith entry of an array.

# Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the 
# fast divide-and-conquer algorithm covered in the video lectures.

# [TIP: before submitting, first test the correctness of your program on some small test files or your own devising.]

# import integers from ./integerArray.txt
